How to Use the JavaScript Toolkit


STEP 1: ADD CLASSES TO YOUR TARGET HTML ELEMENTS

    Available Classes:

	mouseClick - returns time of click on element and total clicks on each element (<h1 class="mouseClick">)
	dblClick - returns time of dblClick on element and total clicks on each element (<p class="dblClick">
	mouseOver - returns time of mouseOver event on element and total mouseovers for each element(<img class="mouseOver">)
	timer - returns length of time user mouse is over an element (<div class="timer">)

STEP 2: ADD adminPageBtn TO YOUR TARGET PAGE (So that you can access our admin data panel)

	(Just copy and paste from below or add your own using id="adminPageBtn")

	<a href="admin.html" class="btn" id="adminPageBtn">Go to Admin Page</a>

STEP 3: ADD OUR SCRIPTS TO YOUR PAGE

	Simply add to the footer of your page and make sure your file location matches the src of our default package structure

      		 <script type="text/javascript" src="scripts/modelDblClick.js"></script>
       		<script type="text/javascript" src="scripts/modelClicks.js"></script>
       		<script type="text/javascript" src="scripts/modelMouseOvers.js"></script>
       		<script type="text/javascript" src="scripts/timer.js"></script>
       		<script type="text/javascript" src="scripts/controller.js"></script>

(STEP 4: GATHER YOUR DATA)

	Our admin panel gives an overview of all the data gathered, as well as allowing you to access all of the raw data that is
	logged. You can also export data to an excel file (with a click of a button) to keep it safe for future reference.




What this toolkit offers

Flexibility

Instead of gathering data for all elements on your site (and having to sort through every piece of data
for the information you're actually looking for) simply add one or more of the available classess
to the class attribute of any html element and the toolkit will do the rest. This feature ensures your data
gathering is targeted and flexible to your needs. Designing an experiment? This will allow you to refine
your data results and ensure you can be in control of all the contents and styling on your page without 
any restrictions.

Reusability

Follow our simple 3 step set-up process and the toolkit will work with any page.
